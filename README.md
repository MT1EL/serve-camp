Project Title: Full-Stack E-Commerce Website

Description:
This project is a full-stack e-commerce website designed for selling handmade woven jumpers, hats, scarves, and toys (often inspired by movie characters). It is built using React.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MySQL for the database. The website includes key features such as user authentication, product pages, services, and testimonials. The design is colorful and intended to evoke a sense of happiness, with a classic layout for the home page that includes both image and text in an inline format. The project is based on a tutorial from YouTube: Full-Stack E-Commerce Tutorial.
